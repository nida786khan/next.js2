        Hello!
I’m Nida Khan, a passionate web developer dedicated to creating high-quality, user-centered websites and applications. With over 1 years of experience in front-end development, I specialize in using modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS to build responsive, fast-loading, and visually appealing web solutions.

I’m driven by the opportunity to blend creativity with technical skills to solve real-world problems and enhance user experience. My goal is to keep growing as a developer and work on projects that make a positive impact.

When I m not coding, you can find me exploring nature trails, experimenting with new photography techniques, or diving into the latest tech trends.
